In this CodeBook you can find the source of the dataset, a description of the dataset,
a description of the files and the variables as well as any transformations made  
in the run_analysis.R script.

##Description
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.  
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)  
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope  
we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.  
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned  
into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then  
sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window).  
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated  
using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force  
is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used.  
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.  

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

##The files
The dataset is contained in a folder named "UCI HAR Dataset".  

The dataset contains the following files:  
* README.txt  
Contains a full description of the dataset
* features_info.txt  
Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
* features.txt:  
List of all features.
* activity_labels.txt  
Links the activity numbers with the corresponding activity name  
(1=WALKING, 2=WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3=WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4=SITTING, 5=STANDING, 6=LAYING)
* train/X_train.txt  
Training set feature values.
* train/y_train.txt  
Training labels.
* test/X_test.txt  
Test set feature values.
* test/y_test.txt
Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

* train/subject_train.txt  
Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.  
Its range is from 1 to 30.
* test/subject_test.txt  
Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.  
Its range is from 1 to 30.
* train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt  
The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'.  
Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt'  
and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
* train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt  
The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
* train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt  
The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

For the purposes of the project, the files in the Inertial Signals folders are not used.

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
